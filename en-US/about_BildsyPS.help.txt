    - Tesseract OCR fallback for non-vision models
    - Cron-triggered agent heartbeat for scheduled tasks
    - Secret scanner to detect exposed API keys at startup
    - Drop-in plugin system with hot-reload
    - User-defined skills and persistent aliases
    - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration

CONFIGURATION
    User data lives under ~/.bildsyps/:
        config/     .env, ChatConfig.json, ToolPreferences.json
        data/       bildsyps.db (SQLite), NaturalLanguageMappings.json

TROUBLESHOOTING
    - Run Test-ChatProvider to verify LLM connectivity.

    - Run secrets to scan for exposed API keys.
    - Set $global:DebugModuleLoading = $true before loading to see errors.
